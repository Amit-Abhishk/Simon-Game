## Overview

### The challenge

- This challenge was to build a game that is modeled off the game Simon.
- The way it works is that we can press any key to start and it will show us a tile that we have to click on.
- As we go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point we're going to screw up, and game is over.
- We can restart the game by pressing any key.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- [Jquery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js)

### What I learned

Basically, I used jquery to built this game along with html,css.

### Continued development

I need to learn jquery more to acknowledged myself with its vast library.

### Useful resources
